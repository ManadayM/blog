<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Asking any gamer, of what makes any game great, would get you to multiple definitions. For some, responsiveness is important, while for others high graphics and resolution. Some might be more interested in racing games, some in strategy games, some in terrorizing while others in world saving games. But apart from all these, one thing that remains in common. Yes, you get it right! After all, why do you play a game? The basic idea is to have Fun!<br /><br />The game that I am introducing you to is based on this simple yet very effective idea. It does deal with heavy graphics or guns or rocket launchers or cars or trains, but with simple circles called the 'Circulets'.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u4bKZaVpobw/UdG6uz7RtWI/AAAAAAAAIDs/UyLGnIhqoPM/s1600/Circulets.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="313" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u4bKZaVpobw/UdG6uz7RtWI/AAAAAAAAIDs/UyLGnIhqoPM/s400/Circulets.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Circulets was released on 8th May and has started gained popularity rapidly<br />Wow, that seems interesting yea? Lets look at it further!<br /><br /><b>How to play:</b><br /><br />It is strictly a multi-player game (2 player to be precise), and played simultaneously on the same device. Two players sit on opposite sides of a table, with the device in between them.<br /><br />The first and most important rule to play this game, is that there are 'No Rules'! When the game begins, the fundamental idea, is to drag the circulets either on your side or throw them on the other side. Determining the circle color is easy, its based on the color sceme of the game. 3 types of circulets might appear on the screen, The color of your side, the color of the opponent side, and the third one, the Bonus circulet, giving you double points!<br /><br />You can either decide to collect the circulets of your color on your side increasing your points, or throw the circulets of your color on the opposite side decreasing theirs. In fact, one more case leads to all the more fun and that is catch hold of the circulet of the color of your opponent and don't leave it.<br /><br />And, as I said earlier, the basic idea is not to win or lose, but to enjoy; have more and more Fun!<br /><br /><b>Game Modes:</b><br /><br />You can either decide a Time Based game mode, wherein the game might go on till some specified time limits, say 30 sec, 60 sec or 90 sec. Another mode, is the Point Based mode, wherein the game will go on till any one of the player reaches the decided Points. Personally speaking, I loved the Point Based mode! It makes the game to go on longer!<br /><br />Now lets see how the game looks like.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtwOaI1XUjY/UdG7OAkUFUI/AAAAAAAAID0/xqSKk7lEWVk/s1600/ipad6.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="313" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dtwOaI1XUjY/UdG7OAkUFUI/AAAAAAAAID0/xqSKk7lEWVk/s400/ipad6.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BfNDjS4Djxk/UdG7blnEhCI/AAAAAAAAID8/Q-NgSDYJGX8/s1600/ipod5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BfNDjS4Djxk/UdG7blnEhCI/AAAAAAAAID8/Q-NgSDYJGX8/s400/ipod5.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />The biggest complain that everyone around a person who addicted to games have, is that that person in engrossed so much in the game, that he or she doesn't have time to look around or talk. Well, not any more! With Circulets, you will be engrossed in the game, but along with your family members, your friends, your buddies and your colleagues! Again, the basic idea of the game is not about winning or losing, but of enjoying and more of whom you are playing with.<br /><br />So are you excited about Circulets? Want to download and play it?
