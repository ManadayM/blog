Home security systems are very expensive these days. But, we can&nbsp;alleviate this issue by using some freely available technologies around us since many years. Skype is one of them - I will show you how to use skype as a real-time monitoring system. I will also cover how to convert web-cam or smartphone camera into a motion-detector camera that alerts you via Email whenever it senses any motion.<br /><div class="ennote" style="-webkit-line-break: after-white-space; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; word-wrap: break-word;"><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBwbEc5NyGs/UhEOl2Q1aEI/AAAAAAAAPNo/lSEf0W8yJBA/s1600/bc18d5add52c489d35f95e1eb946357c-759442.jpeg"><img alt="Thief in action" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5913523829098244162" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pBwbEc5NyGs/UhEOl2Q1aEI/AAAAAAAAPNo/lSEf0W8yJBA/s1600/bc18d5add52c489d35f95e1eb946357c-759442.jpeg" title="Thief in action" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>However, this approach requires your computer or smartphone device to be always in running mode so this may not work for you for the extended period of time. But, it would be best hack if you are just going to your work place or going on a picnic for a day or two.&nbsp;By setting up such real-time monitoring system allows you to keep an eye on your home, pets or kids remotely anytime, anywhere. Besides, setting up motion-detection system will add an extra layer of security from thieves. You can catch them in the action at your home and take some immediate steps to tackle the situation at your home.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the end of this article you will have:</div><div><ol><li>A smart real-time monitoring system using skype that will give you a live view of your home from anywhere in the globe.</li><li>A motion-detector camera using web-cam or smartphone camera that will instantly alert you via Email.<a name='more'></a></li></ol></div><div><br /><h4><b>Real-time Home Monitoring System:</b></h4><br /><div>Setting up a real-time home monitoring system requires</div><div><ul><li>Computer or laptop with a web-cam&nbsp;or Smartphone having Android OS.</li><li>Unlimited internet usage plan at home</li><li>Smartphone/computer to monitor remotely</li></ul><div>As far as my knowledge, Skype on iOS doesn't allow option to receive incoming video calls automatically so it's not possible to setup home monitoring system using Skype on iOS device, still if I'm wrong please correct me. Though there's an alternate option available to iOS users mentioned in&nbsp;Convert smartphone camera into motion detector&nbsp;section.</div></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Steps to set up real-time monitoring system:</b></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="font-weight: normal;">Rather describing the set up process in a multiple long paragraphs way, I will describe them in few easy points below.</div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><ol><li>Install Skype on your home computer or smartphone and create a new account - something like&nbsp;<i>Broadcast_System</i></li><li>Install Skype on your smartphone or another computer and create a new account - something like&nbsp;<i>Monitoring_System</i></li><li>Add each other's skype ids in to the respective contact lists</li><li>In your home system's skype account (here, it's&nbsp;<i>Broadcast_System</i>) go to&nbsp;<i>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy</i>&nbsp;tab</li><li>Set&nbsp;<b>Allow calls from</b>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<b>People in my contact list only</b>&nbsp;and also set&nbsp;<b>Automatically receive video and share screens with</b>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<b>People in my contact lists only</b>. Check the screenshot for the same below.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QkqRybN6kTc/UhEOmlTlPeI/AAAAAAAAPNw/-1N_HymHFA4/s1600/28265eb0d7bc9d27f359ca58d2424d97-761855.png"><img alt="Skype privacy settings" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5913523841726234082" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QkqRybN6kTc/UhEOmlTlPeI/AAAAAAAAPNw/-1N_HymHFA4/s1600/28265eb0d7bc9d27f359ca58d2424d97-761855.png" title="Skype privacy settings" /></a></li></ol></div><div style="font-weight: normal;">Make sure you turn on the home computer and keep logged in into your skype account before going out. You should trun off your monitor and position your web-cam or smartphone in a way that covers maximum area or at least the area you feel critical.&nbsp;That's all. Your real-time monitoring system is ready to serve you the live broadcast of your home from any corner of the globe.</div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-weight: normal;">Now, lets say you want to monitor your home from your office. All you need to do is to make a video call to the home skype account (here,&nbsp;<i>Broadcast_System</i>) from your smartphone/laptop with another skype account (here,&nbsp;<i>Monitoring_System</i>).&nbsp;As you've enabled the option to automatically accept calls and share the video to the people in the contact list on the home system, skype account at home will automatically accept your call and start relaying the live video streaming to you at your end. You can monitor your home in this fashion as many times as you want and that too FREE! Isn't it amazing?</div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-weight: normal;">There are some pros and cons of this monitoring system, though.</div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Pros:</b></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><ul><li>On demand live view of your home</li></ul><b>Cons:</b></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><ul><li>You can't have your eyes all the day on the screen to monitor your home</li><li>No automatic alerts to you in case thief comes into action in your home</li></ul></div></div><div>Lets mitigate the cons part of monitoring system by implementing motion-detection technology in your web-cam or smartphone camera.<br /><br /></div><div><h4><b>Motion Detection alerting system using Web-cam or Smartphone:</b></h4></div><div><br />By converting web-cam or smartphone camera into a motion-detection camera gives you a fine grained control over any motion activity. You can get instant email alerts with an image of your monitoring area as soon as camera at home detects any motion.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is no rocket science or complex procedure involved to enable your camera to sense motion. You just need to install a software on your computer or an app on your smartphone that will start sensing motion in front of your monitoring camera.</div><div><br /></div><div>Lets convert your web-cam or smartphone camera into motion detection alerting system.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>1. Convert computer web-cam into motion detector</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>Below is a list of software tools available for different operating systems.</div><div><ul><li><b>Yawcam (Windows only)</b><br /><br /><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you've placed a windows based computer at home as an monitoring system then I would recommend you to use <a href="http://www.yawcam.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Yawcam</a> software. It allows to enable/disable motion sensing using your web-cam, also offers emails alerts with images when detects motion in front of camera.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">It also keeps a track of motion events with captured images (Check animated image below). Make sure to start Yawcam software and enable motion sensing with Email notifications before you leave your home.</span><br /><br style="font-weight: normal;" /><div style="font-weight: normal;">After enabling Yawcam, you can catch the thief in action at your home easily with mail alerts and do necessary actions to tackle with. You can even make a skype call to the home computer to watch what exactly going on in such a critical circumstance.</div><br style="font-weight: normal;" /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Se57Z_F_Xb4/UhERqv4z5qI/AAAAAAAAPOs/WEOD24c533s/s1600/yawcam-enable-motion-detection.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Yawcam motion detecting software for windows" border="0" height="auto" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Se57Z_F_Xb4/UhERqv4z5qI/AAAAAAAAPOs/WEOD24c533s/s640/yawcam-enable-motion-detection.gif" title="Yawcam motion detecting software for windows" width="600" /></a></div><br /><b></b></div>I've skipped here on how to configure email settings in Yawcam to receive email alerts to keep this article interesting and short. Soon I will write a detailed article on Yawcam motion detection &amp; email settings and will add link to it here.</li><li><b>Vitamin D (Windows, Mac)</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.vitamindinc.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vitamin D</a> also provides motion sensing features with email alerts but the added advantage of Vitamin D is that it's available for both Windows and Mac OS. It is more rich with features and its smart algorithm to detect only People in motion and ignore all other kind of motion events like swaying branches, pets or even light changes from clouds.&nbsp;For example, if you've pet at home, you can set motion detection only for people, so you won't get any unwanted email alerts if your pet at home is playing in front of web-cam.<br /><br />  Vitamin D is a rule based system - You can create a various rules like detect only people walking through a door, or moving objects crossing a line, and much more. In addition, you can choose to be notified by email or a sound alert when those rules are triggered.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B8QOdpJAFUw/UhESKqjHlaI/AAAAAAAAPO4/TSw4dTiQHr4/s1600/vitamin-d-webcam-email-setup.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Vitamin D motion detecting software for windows and mac" border="0" height="auto" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B8QOdpJAFUw/UhESKqjHlaI/AAAAAAAAPO4/TSw4dTiQHr4/s1600/vitamin-d-webcam-email-setup.gif" title="Vitamin D motion detecting software for windows and mac" width="600" /></a></div></li></ul><div><b>2. Convert smartphone camera into motion detector</b><br /><br />If you wish to keep your smartphone at home as an monitoring detector then below apps are recommendations from my side. If you know some other more better app than these 2 then please share it in comments section.</div><ul><li><b>Motion Detector Pro (Android)</b><br /><br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.mvainformatics.android.motiondetectorpro.activity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Motion Detector Pro app</a> enables&nbsp;you to use your android device as a remote surveillance camera or spy cam with motion detection functionality. It uses your inbuilt camera to detect movements in the surrounding area using its own algorithm.If it detects movement it sends an email or a text message with a picture link to another cell phone, allowing you to remotely monitor an area using your Android device.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DhvLUlZfLPI/UhEOomAy15I/AAAAAAAAPOY/jGqHl5686_c/s1600/336afb799bdd77edb20ba5ebe7151a0c-769161.png"><img alt="Motion Detector Pro for android" border="0" height="523" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5913523876275607442" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DhvLUlZfLPI/UhEOomAy15I/AAAAAAAAPOY/jGqHl5686_c/s640/336afb799bdd77edb20ba5ebe7151a0c-769161.png" title="Motion Detector Pro for android" width="640" /></a><br />  The best feature I found in this app is its stealth mode feature which automatically closes the app as soon as the device is touched.</li><li><b>Presence (iOS)</b><br /><br />We all are very well aware how rapidly current smartphone ecosystem gets updated. Today's latest phone is considered outdated within a year. If you are a person who changes phones and tablets frequently to stay abreast with technology then you might have spare iOS device. You can convert that old iOS device into a smart surveillance system using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/presence-by-people-power/id618598211?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Presence app</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DQiCziNnMjo/UhEOpV591lI/AAAAAAAAPOk/2OxTnCCPOU0/s1600/30792006d90470e271f16b02776c1ea6-772477.png"><img alt="Presence surveillance app for iOS" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5913523889131869778" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DQiCziNnMjo/UhEOpV591lI/AAAAAAAAPOk/2OxTnCCPOU0/s1600/30792006d90470e271f16b02776c1ea6-772477.png" title="Presence surveillance app for iOS" /></a><br />  Presence app allows real-time monitoring and alerts when it detects motion. You can customize settings and get an alert with a short video clip when motion is detected.&nbsp;You can tell when someone breaks into your room, when the kids get home from school, and that your elderly relatives are moving about their day.<br /><br />  It also allows 2 way audio-video conversations so you don't need anymore skype for the real-time home monitoring purpose.</li></ul><div>That's all for now. In the coming future I will augment the alerting system that also sends you SMS on your personal phone as soon as your home based surveillance system detects any motion. Also I will write separate articles in the near future on each tools mentioned here with detailed review and how to use each of them.<br /><br />What's your tips for securing home using such freely available technologies?<br /><br />Sharing is caring!</div></div></div>
