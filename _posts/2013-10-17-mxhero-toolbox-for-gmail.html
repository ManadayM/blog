There is plethora of tools available to add extra features to your Gmail account. Though, you’ve to install separate Chrome extensions to get extra functionalities like encrypting mails, email tracking, scheduled mails, etc. Here comes the mxHero Chrome extension into the picture – a single tool to add bunch of useful extra functionalities to your Gmail account. Installing mxHero chrome extension unlocks 5 new features to your Gmail account that are Click Track, Self Destruct, Private Delivery, Send Later and Reply Timeout.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--AqSm3ROlOo/Ul7wTCiCLkI/AAAAAAAARBc/TNgo266ScTY/s1600/mxhero.gif" imageanchor="1"><img alt="mxHero Toolbox" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--AqSm3ROlOo/Ul7wTCiCLkI/AAAAAAAARBc/TNgo266ScTY/s1600/mxhero.gif" title="mxHero Toolbox" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div><br /><a name='more'></a>Once you install the extension, you will see a new mxHero button in yellow color. If you are composing a new mail you will see the button beside the Send button. But, if you are reading a mail then you will found the button in the action panel at extreme top right. The extension is quite easy to use and does not require any manual registration or account creation. Compose your mails normally and when you are done composing, click the mxHero button to use those extra functions.<br /><div><br /><div>Let’s go through what can do mxHero toolbar for you.</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">1.&nbsp;Click Track</span></div><div><br /></div><div>You can get notifications when recipient(s) performs any actions on your mail like accessing mail, clicking links within mail, opening attachment, etc. The notifications are sent out separately for each recipient. However, you can stop being notified whenever you wish so. This feature helps you to infer better time for taking follow up based on recipient’s action on your mail.</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4hwWDT8vFxg/Ul7tI9cn7wI/AAAAAAAARBE/uNV0k81OVvw/s1600/mxhero_mail_access.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Mail Access notification - mxHero Toolbox" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4hwWDT8vFxg/Ul7tI9cn7wI/AAAAAAAARBE/uNV0k81OVvw/s1600/mxhero_mail_access.jpg" title="Mail Access notification - mxHero Toolbox" /></a></div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">2.&nbsp;Self Destruct</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Self destructing mails destruct themselves and cannot be stored by recipients. Once your recipient opens the mail it will destruct in next 5 minutes. The content from the mail body won’t be available after the specified action and time. Seems magical, isn’t it? Though there’s no big rocket science behind. Actually, when you select self destruct option mxHero creates image of your mail content and keep it temporarily on mxHero’s system. So when your mail reaches at the recipient’s end it actually gets transformed in to an image and as soon as recipient reads the mail in the next 5 minutes mxHero will destroy that image from their systems and can’t be retrieved in any case!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I6UBrq7F6kQ/Ul7vhjr7ZSI/AAAAAAAARBQ/0fGcIYn8bjQ/s1600/mxhero_self_destroy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Self destructing mails - mxHero Toolbox" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I6UBrq7F6kQ/Ul7vhjr7ZSI/AAAAAAAARBQ/0fGcIYn8bjQ/s1600/mxhero_self_destroy.jpg" title="Self destructing mails - mxHero Toolbox" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">3.&nbsp;Private Delivery</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Recipients can not view email addresses of other recipients mentioned in To or Cc fields. This approach gives a personal touch to the mail for every recipient of your mail. Each recipient feels that the email has been sent out to him personally as he can’t see other recipients’ addresses in To or Cc fields.</div><div><br /></div><div>For example, when you send an email to <i>barrack.obama@gmail.com</i>, <i>george.bush@gmail.com -</i>&nbsp;each of them will see only their personal email address in the To field. Which means Barrack Obama won’t know that George Bush is also the recipient of the mail and George Bush won’t know that Barrack Obama is also the recipient of the mail.</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">4.&nbsp;Send Later</span></div><div><br /></div><div>This function allows to schedule your mail delivery. You can compose a mail and set the scheduled delivery for the same. Your mail will be sent out automatically at the specified date and time even if you are offline. This is useful for scheduling emails of reminders, birthday greetings, notifications, etc. You can compose a nice birthday greeting mail for your close friend in weekend holidays and then send it using Send Later feature to deliver the mail automatically on your friend’s birthday in the early morning.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V6xQp5MTJic/Ul7sMMo08hI/AAAAAAAARA8/Rllk0KCIj24/s1600/mxhero_schedule_delivery.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Send Later delivery receipt - mxHero toolbox" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V6xQp5MTJic/Ul7sMMo08hI/AAAAAAAARA8/Rllk0KCIj24/s1600/mxhero_schedule_delivery.jpg" title="Send Later delivery receipt - mxHero toolbox" /></a></div><span id="goog_453655272"></span><span id="goog_453655273"></span><br /></div></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">5.&nbsp;Reply Timeout</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Reply Timeout feature sends notification if recipient doesn’t respond to your email within the specified time set by you. However, the feature only works for the recipients added in To field only, recipients in Cc and Bcc will be ignored.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, that's all for mxHero. It’s worth noting that the tool is in beta version and hence you may find it buggy sometimes.
