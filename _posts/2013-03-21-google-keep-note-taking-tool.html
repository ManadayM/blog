<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: left;">Keep - Google's own version of note taking and list-making tool has been announced officially by Google today. It has been launched officially for both Android and Web on the Google Blog.</div><div class="ennote" style="-webkit-line-break: after-white-space; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; word-wrap: break-word;"><div><br /></div><div>You can found this tool at <a href="http://google.drive.com/keep" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://google.drive.com/keep</a> or at <a href="http://goo.gl/sj02O" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStore</a> for Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and above. You can access, edit and create new notes from the above url, as of now, but in the coming weeks Google will integrate the Keep tool directly into the Google Drive.</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UbvkHEDvw-o" width="640"></iframe></div><div><a name='more'></a>Since Keep is on Drive, your notes will sync on your all devices, and notes can be organized in multiple colors, then archived or deleted when they're no longer needed. There's also a transcription tool, which will turn your voice memos into text.&nbsp;On the Android device you can take notes even without un-locking the screen using a lock screen widget (devices running on Android 4.2+).</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HTa5FTnR52k/UUpvuxfTjrI/AAAAAAAAKWE/4gV2J5h55aA/s1600/38bfe13ef325817451d32f7b15e1ae69-763130.jpeg"><img alt="Keep - Google Note Taking and List making Tool" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5857617114698059442" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HTa5FTnR52k/UUpvuxfTjrI/AAAAAAAAKWE/4gV2J5h55aA/s1600/38bfe13ef325817451d32f7b15e1ae69-763130.jpeg" title="Keep - Google Note Taking and List making Tool" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Since this is the initial version, 'Keep'&nbsp;lacks many features like Email address to save note directly from anywhere, Sharing notes via Email, Tagging, Local Notebooks and many more, to which Evernote users are accustomed to. But, hope for the best , It's Google!<br /><br /></div><div class="appbrain-app" id="app67"><a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/google-keep/com.google.android.keep" rel="nofollow" style="color: #555555;" target="_blank">Google Keep for Android on AppBrain</a></div><script language="javascript" src="http://www.appbrain.com/api/api.nocache.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div></div>
