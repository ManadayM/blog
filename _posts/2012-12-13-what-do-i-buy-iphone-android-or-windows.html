<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Anyone who is to buy a Smartphone these days, is bewildered with this question. And this they have long discussions with them who have good knowledge about gadgets and stay updated or those who are currently using it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-24nq1pfjyqQ/UcsxjjeLRLI/AAAAAAAANxg/IKsGE6dpQwQ/s1600/archimedes_35438535_51_610x436.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-24nq1pfjyqQ/UcsxjjeLRLI/AAAAAAAANxg/IKsGE6dpQwQ/s1600/archimedes_35438535_51_610x436.jpg" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"></span><br /><a name='more'></a><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">These new buyers who buy a phone based on some person's experience or recommendation one of the few things may happen, they fall into a trap of buying something they really don't need, spending unnecessary money behind some gadget, unhappy and disappointed with the device and cursing all similar devices based on their experience or happy for getting what they really wanted!</span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, I feel it's only one person who can decide what needs to be bought and it's only YOU yourself. First of all, decide what you really want, what feature is most important for you and what you can do away with in case it is not present.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UdBwLVVWokg/UMjWPyod3BI/AAAAAAAAI9Q/GwAuFEukW5c/s1600/android-apple-win8.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="111" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UdBwLVVWokg/UMjWPyod3BI/AAAAAAAAI9Q/GwAuFEukW5c/s400/android-apple-win8.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Some of the preliminary questions that you need to ask yourself, before you buy any smart phone are as follows:</span><br /><b style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></b><b style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Do I really need a smartphone, or is it just because everyone around has it, I want it?</b><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If the answer to this question is NO, please don't fall into the trap of buying one unnecessarily. The reason is, technology obsolescence rate is too high. And by the time you really need to use a smartphone, your device would be outdated and you might not have a budget to buy one.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>What is my Budget, can I exceed it - if I like a smartphone which I really don't need?</b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">You can not have a budget of some 10K and plan to buy an iPhone 5 or a Samsung Galaxy SIII or a Nokia Lumia 820 or 920. And in case you need them, then don't care for your budget! But yes, you can suffice with a Micromax A84 Supafone Elite (but don't expect it to give the same performance as a Samsung SIII does, It may, it may not!)&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>What feature matters to me the most?</b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">While searching for a smartphone ask few questions to yourself, what feature matters to me the most, User-friendly OS, Camera, Customization, Apps, Touch, Battery backup, Expandable Memory, Upgrades of Operating system, Nice music, Easy Data Transfer or anything specific in your case. It is after this when you can decide which one is the best phone for you.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><b>Are you a fan of some specific technology and taken away by it, say Android Fan, or Apple Freak?</b></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Well, if you are a fan of any particular technology, and want to buy a phone of that technology only, still at least have a look at what others are offering. It may be that what you really need, is given by some technology that you are not aware of and by the time you get to know about it, it gets late.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">That may result in a situation of you start hating or disliking your device.</span><br /><div><b style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></b></div><div><b style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Have you used one technology smartphone, and want to switch over to other technology just to know how it is?</b><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Every operating system has its own set of pros and cons. So you simply can't compare an Android version with an iPhone and then say that any particular phone and its OS is crap as it doesn't have a particular thing!</span><br /><b style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></b><b style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Few more things to consider</b><br /><ul><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Satisfied with what you already use? DO NOT CHANGE IT! If you have used one technology, you must have a look at what others are providing as features, but don't take a risk of getting into other technology, if you like what you use currently. Seriously Don't! Your technology developers will get you new features soon.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">If Touch and/or Camera is more important for you, Apple and Windows should be your prime options. I would tend to go towards Apple more in this case.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Data Sharing? - Android, as you don't get&nbsp;Bluetooth connectivity&nbsp;with Apple and Windows.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Expandable memory? - Android (except HTC X One) or Windows as iPhone has a fixed Memory</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Limited Budget? - Android</span></li></ul><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Comments questions and your reviews are very welcome!</span></div></div>
