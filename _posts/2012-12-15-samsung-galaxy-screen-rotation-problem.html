<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Georgia; text-align: -webkit-auto;">I found this question on many Android forums, regarding screen rotation not working suddenly, in devices like Samsung Galaxy S2,&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note&nbsp;and Samsung Galaxy S3.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Georgia; text-align: -webkit-auto;">I searched for it because I had the same issue. Yes, even my device had the same problem, (I can proudly say had because now it is solved!).&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Georgia; text-align: -webkit-auto;">After searching for around 15 forums, and 40+ posts, I was able to find a solution for the screen rotation issue. Pheww! Feels good!</span></span><br /><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><div><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fZRoXwD7sGI/UMQ9apQLHLI/AAAAAAAAI48/Nw_Hr80iJ38/s1600/602fd0394e9f75bfd01ed1abf0841ca6-756597.png" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><img alt="Samsung Galaxy Mobiles" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fZRoXwD7sGI/UMQ9apQLHLI/AAAAAAAAI48/Nw_Hr80iJ38/s1600/602fd0394e9f75bfd01ed1abf0841ca6-756597.png" title="Samsung Galaxy Mobiles" /></span></a></div><div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span><br /><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b>What all did I try that didn't work out:</b></span></div><ol><li><span style="font-family: Georgia;">They said, remove applications that might be using or getting custom rotations types, remove games that require rotation - better remove all those apps that use some kind of rotation keep running in background, which eventually comes out to be large in number if you are&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;a gamer or a reader.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Better get a factory reset done. (This statement nearly gives you a mild stroke, I know, I had the same effect when I read that!)</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Try doing&nbsp;both&nbsp;Calibration&nbsp;- Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Horizontal Calibration, &nbsp;Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Gyroscope Calibration. - For me,&nbsp;Gyroscope Calibration was done perfectly, but&nbsp;every-time, while doing&nbsp;Horizontal Calibration, my device would restart.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Georgia;">You need to get your PCB Changed, get it done fast, sooner the better.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Georgia;">It is something related to some Hardware, better go to Samsung Service Center.</span></li></ol><div><b><span style="font-family: Georgia;">What got me to the Solution:</span></b><br /><div><b><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></b></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia;">After trying so many things out there on my device, except factory reset and hardware changes - I was almost ready to give it to Samsung Service Center, and took backup of my messages and contacts in my SIM card, to transfer that on my backup phone.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia;">I switched off my phone and took the SIM out and put it in the other phone. As I have many contacts and messages, I had to repeat this activity multiple number of times. After doing this around 4 times, I thought of checking again, whether some luck in Screen Rotation issue.&nbsp;And to my astonishment, the Screen Rotate had started working!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Georgia;">So then, I searched on forums, with a similar search key, Screen Rotation + Samsung + Crash Horizontal Calibration, remove SIM card and somewhere I found a useful link that said the same to confirm my R&amp;D.&nbsp;Here it is,&nbsp;<a href="http://androidforums.com/samsung-galaxy-s2-international/575534-auto-rotation-not-working-crashes-during-horizontal-calibration.html" rel="nofollow" style="color: #1155cc;" target="_blank">http://androidforums.com/<wbr></wbr>samsung-galaxy-s2-<wbr></wbr>international/575534-auto-<wbr></wbr>rotation-not-working-crashes-<wbr></wbr>during-horizontal-calibration.<wbr></wbr>html</a>.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br />The user said the same.&nbsp;So it was confirmed. So in case, you are having the same issue, please try removing the SIM Card and let us know if it helps you out or not!
