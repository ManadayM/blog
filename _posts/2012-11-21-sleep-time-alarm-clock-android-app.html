Sleep Time Alarm Clock Android app replaces the Traditional Alarm with the Smart Alarm that tracks your sleep cycles whole night and wakes you up gently in the morning when you are not in deep sleep! The app uses your smartphone's/tablet's sensors to track your movements during the sleep. Sleep Time Alarm Clock is a free download, and it's compatible with just about everything out there.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vuPNcSUnSIE/UKvX2IvkN_I/AAAAAAAAIdw/IEKE1ny0iTw/s640/49c21ee06a6920b2aa07b62204d90bc6-792118.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="sleept time alarm clock android app" border="0" height="376" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vuPNcSUnSIE/UKvX2IvkN_I/AAAAAAAAIdw/IEKE1ny0iTw/s640/49c21ee06a6920b2aa07b62204d90bc6-792118.png" title="sleept time alarm clock android app" width="600" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Sleep Time uses the sensitive accelerometer in your Android device to detect movements during the sleep. Its advanced algorithm determines your phase of sleep, and sets off the alarm at the perfect moment. You can use it just to analyze your sleeping patterns and movements, but it really shines when you set an alarm. The app will wake you at the lightest part of your sleep cycle, so you don't want up feeling ripped out of a deep sleep. If the app detects you'll be in a deep sleep at your alarm time, it'll wake you a little sooner so you don't feel groggy when it's time to get up. Users who try this method have mixed results, but there are plenty who loved it.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The app has been developed by Azumio, creators of the popular Instant Heart Rate. The app is beautiful with bright colors and animations. Setting the alarm itself is done in a smart and fresh fashion: just swipe your finger around the clock to set it. I must admit, it's a lot more intuitive than the native up/down arrows. After your first night of sleep, it'll even report on your sleep cycle for you. If you're looking for a new way to wake up (or just a pretty alternative to the default alarm), give Sleep Time Alarm Clock a try.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div class="appbrain-app" id="app368"><a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/sleep-time-alarm-clock/com.azumio.android.sleeptime" style="color: #555555; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Sleep Time - Alarm Clock for Android on AppBrain</a></div><script language="javascript" src="http://www.appbrain.com/api/api.nocache.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div>
