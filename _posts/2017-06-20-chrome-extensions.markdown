List of useful Chrome Extensions that I use.

[Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/)

Best tool to share notes and links across your devices like Desktop browser to Mobile and vice versa. It also mirrors your mobile notification on your desktop.

[Awesome Schreenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj)

Screencast, record screen as video. Screen capture for full page, annotate, blur sensitive info, and share with one-click uploads.

[GistBox Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gistbox-clipper/cejmhmbmafamjegaebkjhnckhepgmido)

This extension would be handy to clip important code-snippets and save it into your Github account as Gist.
