<p>A budget WiFi router was there in my wish-list since months. I wanted to buy a simplest and cheapest yet good WiFi router which fulfils my primary requirment to convert Wired internet into Wireless. No any advanced requirements.</P>

<p>I searched and read many user reviews for variety of routers and finally landed my choice on <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/offer-listing/B001FWYGJS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24790&creativeASIN=B001FWYGJS&linkCode=am2&tag=manamava-21&linkId=5UOR7QNLMN2GGIW5">TP-Link WR841N</a>. I got a great deal from Amazon India and got it delivered in 3-4 business days. The overall product packaging was excellent, never felt that it is a cheap device.</p>

<p>Indeed, my decision to go with TP-Link WR841N turned a right choice. The device has neighter restarted nor has lost connection abruptly till the date.</p>
