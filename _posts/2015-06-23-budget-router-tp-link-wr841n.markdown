<p>A budget WiFi router was there in my wish-list since months. I wanted to buy a simplest and cheapest yet good WiFi router which fulfils my primary requirment to convert Wired internet connection into a Wireless one. No any advanced requirements.</P>

<p>I searched and read many user reviews for variety of routers and finally landed my choice on TP-Link WR841N. I got a great deal from Amazon India and got it delivered in 3-4 business days. The overall product packageing was excellent, never felt that it's a very cheap and low quality device.</p>

<p>Indeed, my decision to go with TP-Link WR841N turned a nice choice. The device has neigther restarted since days nor it lost connection abruptly.</p>
